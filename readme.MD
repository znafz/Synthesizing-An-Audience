#Synthesizing an Audience
##About
One of my favorite hobbies is writing and recording music, but building up a fanbase is difficult. To try to boost my number of listeners a bit, I created scripts that automatically interact with other users. I created one for soundcloud, and one for twitter, both written in Python. In soundcloud, I saw some definite results although twitter was not particularly successful.

##Using
Before using make sure you have the required dependencies: soundcloud-python and tweepy. These can be installed using pip.
After getting the required packages, make sure you have an application created in both soundcloud and twitter. Using the tokens that are provided and your credentials, fill out the required sections in the code. For example, replace YOUR_USERNAME with the username of your account in the respective site.

##A Word of Warning
Be careful when running these scripts. If you spam the sites, you could get your account blocked. I created these scripts out of curiosity, and I wouldn't recommend using them over an extended period of time.
